                central portal to discover agrosystem-related datasets and
                research data repositories.
                <EuiSpacer size={"m"} />
                All information is aggregated from established sources and made
                searchable in this service. Our aim is to foster the
                implementation of the FAIR principles (Findability,
                Accessibility, Interoperability and Reusability) in the
                agricultural research domain. And the metadata for contained
                datasets are automatically harvested by the FAIRagro Middleware
                and transformed into a standardised metadata schema.
                <EuiSpacer size={"m"} />
                The FAIRagro Search Hub provides various search and filter
                functions, e.g. based on crop species or repository subject of
                research. Additional options are currently under development.
                <EuiSpacer size={"m"} />
                As the platform is being developed for the community, it must
                meet the needs and requirements of the community. To ensure
                this, we are working closely with domain experts within the
                FAIRagro project, especially the FAIRagro Use Cases, who
                represent the community of interest. However, we also invite
                everyone else to suggest features, ideas, or requirements and
                report bugs to the development team. You can do this by using
                the green feedback box on the right side of the screen.
